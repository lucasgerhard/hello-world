Finally!! Now I think this is working!<br />
<br />
This is the 4th version, and as far as I can see, this code can determin if a number is prime or not.<br />
My biggest problem was that I was doing it trought a diferent method: I was checking the divisibility from 2 to 9.<br />
This was leaving out the divisibility by multiples of primes!<br />
<br />
The version 4 uses a sequence of divisions to determine how many factors does a given number has. Then, if there is only 1 factor, it is said to be a prime number.<br />
Works much better, I think!<br />

Here is it: (PRESS "RUN" to use it)<br />
